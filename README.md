Individual Group Contribution

This is a my own Individual Contribution to the project. I had completed the Staff and Customer module. Both module can create, read, update and delete the data directly using GUI interface to do changes to the database. The user can easily handle the operation of CRUD with all the navigation elements such as navigation bar and button. While making any changes, a message would pop out to notify what the users had done.
